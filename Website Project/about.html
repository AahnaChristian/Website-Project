    <h2>9 Main Styles of Art</h2>

    <!-- Abstract -->
    <div class="bg1" style='background-image:url("img/abstract.jpg");'>
        <p class="format">Abstract</p>
    </div>

    <div style="position:relative;">
        <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
            <p>Abstract paintings can be difficult to comprehend because they don't portray anything actual — no person,
                no
                place, no item. Artists use colours, shapes, forms, and expressive gestures such as a paint stroke or
                even a
                seemingly random splash to get the desired impression.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Modern -->
    <div class="bg2" style="background-image:url('img/modern.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Modern</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>Modern art, which spanned the years 1860 to 1970, broke away from traditional techniques and styles.
            Modern
            art is difficult to define because it relates to a period in time rather than a form of art. Modern art,
            on
            the other hand, is defined as "the artist's purpose to portray a topic as it exists in the world,
            according
            to his or her unique perspective, and is distinguished by a rejection of established or traditional
            techniques and ideals," according to The Art Story.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Impressionist -->
    <div class="bg3" style="background-image:url('img/impressionist.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Impressionist</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>Impressionist artists "integrated new scientific studies into the physics of colour to achieve a more
            precise
            portrayal of colour and tone," according to Art Movements. The artist's interpretation of the topic
            matter
            was more important than the subject matter itself. The subjective aspect of storytelling is what makes
            it so
            appealing.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Pop Art -->
    <div class="bg4" style="background-image:url('img/pop_art.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Pop Art</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>Popular culture and mass media imagery, such as news, advertising, movie stars, and comic books, are
            frequently used in pop art. It posed a challenge to fine art traditions in its early stages. Pop art now
            is
            influenced by that era, and it is full of colour and joy.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Cubism -->
    <div class="bg4" style="background-image:url('img/cubism.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Cubism</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>Cubism includes 'three fundamental parts - geometricity, simultaneity (many viewpoints), and passage,'
            according to Art History. Artists work in the 'fourth dimension,' which is why cubism pieces frequently
            depict the same subject from many perspectives — it's a search for meaning or comprehension, pointing
            out
            that the world is not as it appears. That's why cubism is known for its vibrant colours and vibrant
            vitality!</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Surrealism -->
    <div class="bg4" style="background-image:url('img/surrealism.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Surrealism</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>Surrealism is a style of expression that "goes beyond reality." It takes genuine objects and positions
            them
            in bizarre circumstances. It's devoid of both consciousness and convention. It's like though I'm in a
            dream.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Contemporary -->
    <div class="bg4" style="background-image:url('img/contemporary.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Contemporary</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>While the term "modern" relates to a specific time period, "contemporary" refers to the present, thus
            it's a
            style that's always evolving because it's the style of the moment. Contemporary art is fundamentally
            "the
            creation of new art," however it can relate to work created in the recent six months to a year, or even
            two
            to 10 years for some art curators (Art Gallery NSW).</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Fantasy -->
    <div class="bg4" style="background-image:url('img/fantasy.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Fantasy</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>Folk art from many centuries ago, as well as Christian mythological art, Greek and Roman art, have all
            influenced fantasy art. Fantasy art originated in the literary world and was mostly used to illustrate
            stories.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Graffiti -->
    <div class="bg4" style="background-image:url('img/graffiti.jpg');">
        <p class="format">Graffiti</p>
    </div>

    <div style="color:#ddd;text-align:center;padding:50px 80px;text-align: justify;">
        <p>Generally painted on public walls, graffiti is a consistently developing form of popular art, ranging
            from
            slogans and words to detailed and colourful wall paintings.</p>
